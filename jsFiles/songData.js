        title: "Imperfect",
        releaseDate: "January 24, 2025",
        genre: "Ballad/Singer-Songwriter",
        about:"Imperfect was the first song by The Dorm Collective, written by Caleb and Aidan during their first semester at Belmont. Recorded and released at the beginning of their second semester, it kickstarted The Dorm Collective’s journey. This heartfelt song explores how flaws can create deep, meaningful relationships. It opens with one person dreaming of an ideal version of themselves and the perfect relationship. In responce, another voice comes and reassures them that these imperfections are what make them human and worthy of love. The final moments of the song emphasize unity and the authenticity of relationships. It ends with shared realization that no one can be everything on their own - we all need someone by our side.",
        lyrics:"V1<br>If I was perfect<br>I’d be everything you need my love<br>I don’t know how<br>We’d be together<br>I wouldn’t miss you<br>I’d be holding you right now<br><br>C1<br>With your head on my shoulder,<br>we’d stay here forever<br>You and I, to the end, <br>we’d grow old together<br><br>V2<br>If you were perfect<br>You wouldn’t need me<br>My dream is everything you bring<br>I’m right here waiting<br>Don’t leave me here all on my own<br>You are everything to me<br><br>C2<br>I won’t let you go, through this alone, <br>I’m by your side, through the stormy weather<br>With you I’m there, all the way, <br>Either through worse or better<br><br>[Instrumental Bridge]<br><br>V3<br>We can be perfect<br>I’m here for you, and that won’t change<br>Imperfect hearts with no restraints<br><br>C3<br>No one can be, everything, by themself, we all need somebody<br>I’m right here, by your side, lay you feelings on me<br><br>C4<br>No one can be, everything, by themself, we all need somebody<br>Look beyond, what’s imperfect, you will be set free<br><br>Hook<br>You can’t be perfect, but we’re still worth it<br>Cuz in your own way, you are perfect",

        title: "End of the Road",
        releaseDate: "July 25, 2025",
        genre: "Pop-Rock/Alternative",
        about:"“End of The Road” is a pop-rock anthem that explores the tension between fear and hope in a relationship. Written from the perspective of someone fighting to hold on, the song blends emotional vulnerability with defiant optimism. The lyric “This is not the end of the road” first came to Caleb during a quiet moment in class. It quickly became the foundation for the entire track. The song begins with a quiet sense of lament and uncertainty, but gradually shifts into a passionate plea. The bridge serves as a heartfelt turning point, a final cry not to let the story die. It ends with a reaffirmation that love can rise above fear. As repeated in the chorus, “End of The Road” is a reminder that relationships, even in their hardest moments, are worth fighting for.",
